# Full-Adder_with_hybrid_design_IITH_hackathon
Full-Adder Digital circuit design using full swing hybrid design style Using Synopsys Custom-compiler in 28nm technology
 Here, I am going to design and implement 1-bit Full 
Adder cell in full-swing hybrid logic style using 28nm technology.
This proposed adder is supposed to achieve improvement in 
Propagation delay, improvement in average power and also 
improvement in power delay product in comparison to 
conventional CMOS mirror Full-Adder while operating at 0.8 
volts. As a whole, the performance is better than rest od the Full Adder cell.
